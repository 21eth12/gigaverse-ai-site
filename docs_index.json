This allows the builders at GLHF to operate with complete agility and to always deliver on what our players want most. \n\nCore game design principles include: (1) keeping it easy to understand and play (we want your uncle Jebediah and your little niece Zelda to enjoy the game), (2) building features that give players the thrill of taking risks (good luck) and earning rewards (have fun), and (3) leveraging the power of nostalgia through top tier pixels and a timeless RPG story you play a central role in. \n\nWe look forward to welcoming you to Gigaverse. \n\n— GLHF Team\n\nLast updated 20 days ago"
