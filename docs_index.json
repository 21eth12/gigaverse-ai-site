This allows the builders at GLHF to operate with complete agility and to always deliver on what our players want most.\n\nCore game design principles include: (1) keeping it easy to understand and play (we want your uncle Jebediah and your little niece Zelda to enjoy the game), (2) building features that give players the thrill of taking risks (good luck) and earning rewards (have fun), and (3) leveraging the power of nostalgia through top tier pixels and a timeless RPG story you play a central role in.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming you to Gigaverse.\n\n— GLHF Team\n\nLast updated 20 days ago"

They are a deflationary ERC-721 NFT collection on Ethereum Mainnet and are regarded as \"THE crypto gaming PFP\" by the community.\n\nThe collection launched in January 2024 and minted at a price of 0.0369 ETH per NFT. The mint of GLHFers used a novel approach to WL curation — \"programmatic whitelisting\" via the Adjutant bot, which was also built by GLHF.\n\nThe original supply of the collection was 3,690 NFTs, with only 3,154 being available via the general mint, and the final 150 tokens reserved as Special Characters (1/1s) to be slowly auctioned over time by the Auctioneer. Learn more about him here: Auctioneer.\n\nInspiration\n\nGLHFers is a nostalgia-infused collection inspired by the golden age of gaming: the 1990s. The collection was created by Gigaverse's lead artist, Bunyoo, who paid homage to the games we know & love from our childhoods through the overall style of the collection and character traits.\n\nSpecial Characters (1/1s)\n\nThe GLHFers collection contains a total of 200 Special Characters (1/1s). Their status as Special Characters is reflected in the collection metadata.\n\nWhen Special Characters are auctioned by the Auctioneer, they are often done so with some sort of unique auction mechanic, or other utility or benefit that he specifies at the time.\n\nThe most recent set of auctions, the Masters of the Gigaverse, function as Skin Factories within Gigaverse, providing the owners of these NFTs with unique skins dripped out to them on a weekly basis."

There will never be any surprise mints or auctions for the GLHFers collection.\n\nAuctions are announced by the Auctioneer. In the past, they have run for 24 hours and bids are made in ETH. If a bidder is outbid, their ETH is returned to them immediately.\n\nYou can see auctions here and the bids that were made on them here.\n\nDeflationary Mechanic\n\nThe GLHFers collection is deflationary because the Auctioneer uses funds he raises from auctions to sweep & burn the floor of the collection. To date, he has burned 420 GLHFers from the collection, forever removing them from the supply.\n\nMarketplace:\n\nOpenSea (Ethereum)\n\nDifference between GLHFers and Gigaverse ROMs\n\nCheck this Article by Dith on the differences between our collections\n\nLast updated 20 days ago"

Fish swim to a different cell each turn, after you play a spell card.\n\nSpells (cards) have mana costs, hit locations, and damage indicators. Click the card with hit boxes that you predict the fish will travel to on the turn. Successful “hits” will increase the catch meter, while a “miss” will decrease it.

If you are out of mana before the catch meter fills, or the catch meter goes to zero, the fish escapes and your cast ends.\n\nEntry Requirement\n\nThere are three levels of cast requiring scaling energy:\n\nSmall Cast 12 energy\n\nNormal Cast 16 energy\n\nBig Cast 20 energy\n\nFishing Equipment\n\nYou can equip Fishing Rods that provide a set of starting spells depending on the Rod type and rarity.\n\nRewards\n\nYou can catch different types of fish having unique stats and rarities:\n\n🔢 Stats: Weight (WGT), Length (LNG) and Girth (GRT)\n\n⭐ Rarity: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Relic, Giga\n\nHigher Rarity fish are worth more Seaweed at Tonno, the Fishing Vendor.\n\nDaily Limit\n\nNormal: 10 casts per day\n\nJuiced Player: 20 casts per day"

    "text": "Consumables are one-time use potions that can be used in combat to help you progress further in the dungeon. They can be crafted at the Alchemy Bench, or purchased on the gigamarket.\n\nConsumables require faction-specific ingredients that are only produced by ROMs with those faction traits. So if you wish to craft all the various different consumables, it is beneficial to hold ROMs of each different faction type.\n\nHow does your faction affect recipe requirements?\n\nDepending on the faction you chose when you entered Gigaverse (Factions) you will have different material requirements for crafting consumables. This is by design.\n\nLast updated 21 days ago"

Head skins & body skins can be turned in to head gear & body gear which has stat points, giving you an advantage in combat.\n\nGear cannot be traded once crafted, only vanity (cosmetic skins) can\n\nRarity\n\nGear exists in different levels. Higher rarity gear has increased stat points and/or more durability.\n\nUpon Crafting and Restoring Gear, you have a % chance of rolling common, uncommon, rare, or epic gear:\n\n(50%) Common\n\n(30%) Uncommon\n\n(15%) Rare\n\n(5%) Epic\n\nYou can preview the stats of each rarity tier in the Workbenchby clicking on a piece of gear and clicking the rarity circle with the percentages to it.\n\nDurability\n\nGear degrades with use, until it breaks. Once broken, its stats / utility no longer work. It must be repaired using resources to restore it to its full capability.\n\nRepairs\n\nYou can repair gear at the Gear Station for a cost.\n\nTo find the cost, go to the Gear Station, select a piece of gear, and above the “Repair” button you will see the cost.\n\nRepair Limit: Each piece of Gear has a repair limit.\n\nExample: Head and Body gear can be repaired 5 times, you will see a 0/5 upon first craft, moving up by 1 with each repair.\n\nOnce a repair limit is reached, the gear will no longer function and/or give stats.\n\nRestoration\n\nSome Gear, like Head & Body Gear, can be “Restored” with Gear Ember."
